# Weather Service

* Provisions infrastructure with Vagrant, Terraform, and Ansible.
* Creates a tiny Flask application
* Illustrates using infrasture as code while using Google Docs for a tutorial style reference

```
$ while true; do curl weather.egfast.com; done
hello from version 0.1.5 running on app02-prod.prod.egfast.com
hello from version 0.1.5 running on app01-prod.prod.egfast.com
hello from version 0.1.5 running on app03-prod.prod.egfast.com
```

## Working Session

Refer to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybMxKulX-vbDCtF_E9eKiYMNKLa9ySWMpc5Ejsfv5bw/edit?usp=sharing) for a tutorial style reference.

I like using a different web application like Quip for internal docs instead of going straight to a README because a web application is easier for other people on a team or in an organization to change. After enough people have commented, asked questions, made edits, etc. then the doc can get converted into a more static README.
